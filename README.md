# isobar_code_challenge
The solution is comprised of two solutions, one solution('isobar_code_test') contains web forms along with web api and another('isobar_code_test.Tests') is a unit test project to test web api.
We can run the solution 'isobar_code_test' directly by using 'F5' command.

Currently, I am using google maps api to get lat/lng for addresses sepecified in the text file.We can store the lat/lng coordinates for the addresses to avoid calling google map api on run time.

I have attached the you tube video link in which I have demonstrated the solution.
